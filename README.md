# Cypress exercise

## Getting started
- Install dependencies with npm
```
$ npm i
```
- Run the project
```
npm run cypress open
```

## Assignment
**Your challenge is to list all test cases you would automate for the below form. Write at least two ready test cases and just list the rest.**

- This assignment is not a test. We just want to get a feeling of how you do automation and create test cases
- Running the project will open a page with a form:
  - Explore the form (https://brella-react-git-temp-qa-form-brella.vercel.app)
  - See what it does and what it does not do and decide what you think makes sense to automate
- Use a private github repository to share your project or send it in a git bundle
  - If you need any help, please let us know!
- We won't use your code in any way. Whatever you produce, belongs to you

Let us know if there is something you feel uncertain about or get stuck. We can solve it together.

How would you improve this assignment? Please share your thoughts.
